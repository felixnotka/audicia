# Changelog

All notable changes to Audicia are documented here.

The project uses automatic patch-level versioning: `version.json` defines
Major.Minor, and CI auto-increments the patch on each release to `main`.

---

## 0.4.1

### Removed

- **Kube-proxy-free workarounds** — removed `hostNetwork`, `dnsPolicy`,
  `webhook.hostPort`, and `webhook.service.nodePort` Helm values and all
  associated template logic. These were workarounds for a misconfigured host
  firewall, not an inherent kube-proxy-free issue. The operator is a normal
  Kubernetes operator that expects cluster networking to work.
- **Startup retry with exponential backoff** — removed `startWithRetry` and the
  `STARTUP_MAX_RETRIES` environment variable from the operator binary. The
  operator now starts directly; Kubernetes' own restart policy handles transient
  failures.
- **Kube-Proxy-Free Guide** — deleted `docs/guides/kube-proxy-free.md` and
  removed it from the site navigation. Added a one-line troubleshooting entry
  instead: ensure your host firewall allows traffic from the pod CIDR.

### Changed

- **Leader election re-enabled by default** — `operator.leaderElection.enabled`
  now defaults to `true`, matching standard operator behaviour. Disable
  explicitly with `operator.leaderElection.enabled=false` for single-replica
  deployments.

---

## 0.4.0

**Released:** 2026-03-04

Official public launch.

### Changed

- **Version bump to 0.4.0** — first publicly announced release
- **OG social preview image** — centered layout with larger logo and text for
  better rendering in Teams, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn link previews
- **Helm chart appVersion** — updated from `0.1.0` to `0.4.0` to match the
  release version

### Fixed

- **Double `.md` extension in doc/blog routes** — requests ending in `.md` (e.g.
  `/docs/getting-started/introduction.md`) no longer 404 with a
  `readfile 'introduction.md.md'` error; the slug is now stripped before
  building the file path

---

## 0.3.10

**Released:** 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **Operator build triggering on docs-only pushes** — `dorny/paths-filter` in
  the pipeline workflow now compares against `HEAD~1` instead of the push
  event's `before` SHA, preventing multi-commit pushes from falsely detecting
  operator changes

---

## 0.3.9

**Released:** 2026-03-04

### Changed

- **Changelog backfill** — added release dates (from git tags) to all 16
  versions and added missing entries for 0.1.3, 0.1.4, 0.3.5, and 0.3.6
- **Brand assets** — added logo variants (mark and text in dark-on-white,
  green-on-navy, white-on-navy) and SVG source, replaced favicon, added OG image

### Removed

- **Kubestronaut image** — removed unused `kubestronaut.png` from site static
  assets
- **Cloud vendor quick start guides** — deleted `quick-start-eks.md`,
  `quick-start-aks.md`, and `quick-start-gke.md` which were full infrastructure
  setup procedures mislabeled as quick starts; the dedicated setup guides
  (`eks-setup.md`, `aks-setup.md`, `gke-setup.md`) already cover this content

### Fixed

- **Broken AKS link in blog post** — the Kubernetes audit logging guide now
  links to the AKS setup guide (`guides/aks-setup`) instead of the deleted quick
  start

---

## 0.3.8

**Released:** 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **Malformed ServiceAccount empty name** — `NormalizeSubject` now rejects
  usernames like `system:serviceaccount:ns:` where the SA name after the final
  colon is empty, which previously produced a `Subject` with `Name: ""` and
  invalid report names (`report-`)
- **NonResourceURL rules fail CRD validation** — the aggregator now initialises
  `APIGroups` and `Resources` to empty slices (`[]`) for NonResourceURL rules
  instead of leaving them nil, which serialised as `null` and failed the
  required-field validation (`status.observedRules[].apiGroups: Required value`)
- **Nil slices in ComplianceRule output** — `scopedToComplianceRule` and
  `observedToComplianceRule` now use `emptyIfNil` to guarantee `[]` instead of
  `null` for `apiGroups`, `resources`, and `verbs` in excess/uncovered rule
  lists

---

## 0.3.7

**Released:** 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **Empty-subject report names** — `NormalizeSubject` now rejects empty
  usernames, preventing invalid report names like `report-` that fail Kubernetes
  naming validation
- **Unresolvable audit events** — `processEvent` now skips events with no
  `objectRef` and no `requestURI`, which previously produced rules with empty
  `apiGroups`/`resources` that fail CRD validation
  (`status.observedRules[].apiGroups: Required value`)
- **Underscore in report names** — `sanitizeName` now replaces underscores with
  hyphens, and trims leading hyphens in addition to trailing ones, producing RFC
  1123-compliant resource names (e.g., `felix_notka_admin` →
  `felix-notka-admin`)
- **EKS IAM policy missing log-stream resource** — CloudWatch Logs
  `FilterLogEvents` requires a separate `log-stream:*` resource ARN; both EKS
  guides now include both resource patterns in the IAM policy
- **Redundant `--version` in Helm install** — all cloud guides (EKS, AKS, GKE)
  no longer pass `--version` to `helm install`, since the chart version is
  independent of the image tag set in the values file

---

## 0.3.6

**Released:** 2026-03-02

### Added

- **IRSA verification steps** — EKS guides now include ServiceAccount annotation
  and pod environment variable checks before verifying event flow
- **STS AccessDenied callout** — quick-start EKS includes a diagnostic note
  distinguishing IRSA trust errors from CloudWatch Logs permission errors
- **Expanded EKS troubleshooting** — three new rows covering STS
  AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity failures, eksctl/Helm role ARN mismatches, and IRSA
  webhook injection issues

### Changed

- **File-based patterns for editable manifests** — guides that require
  user-specific values (IAM policies, trust policies, AudiciaSource YAMLs) now
  instruct users to create and edit files before applying, while static
  manifests use inline heredocs
- **EKS IRSA setup split into two options** — the EKS Setup Guide now presents
  eksctl (recommended) and manual IAM role as mutually exclusive options with
  separate Helm values, preventing the double-ownership bug where both eksctl
  and Helm manage the ServiceAccount annotation
- **Standardized log commands** — all guides consistently use
  `kubectl logs -f -n audicia-system deploy/audicia-operator`

### Fixed

- **EKS IRSA double ownership** — quick-start EKS now uses
  `serviceAccount.create: false` when eksctl manages the ServiceAccount, with a
  warning against mixing approaches
- **Premature verification step** — removed ServiceAccount check from EKS setup
  that ran before the namespace existed
- **Typo** — fixed `deploy/audciia-operator` → `deploy/audicia-operator` in EKS
  Setup Guide

---

## 0.3.5

**Released:** 2026-02-27

### Changed

- **Streamlined webhook and kube-proxy-free guides** — trimmed
  `webhook-setup.md` from ~530 to ~440 lines and `kube-proxy-free.md` from ~300
  to ~210 lines by removing repeated warnings, edge-case notes, and tangential
  explanations
- **Deleted redundant `mtls-setup.md` stub** — the redirect page from 0.3.3 is
  no longer needed now that all cross-references point to `webhook-setup.md`
- **Docs navigation restructured** — split into "Setup Guides" and "Guides"
  sections
- Fixed `audicia-audicia-operator` naming across docs and broken anchors from
  the restructure

---

## 0.3.4

**Released:** 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **Helm resource naming** — set `fullnameOverride: "audicia-operator"` so that
  all resources (Deployment, ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, etc.) are named
  `audicia-operator` regardless of the Helm release name. Previously, using
  `helm install audicia` produced `audicia-audicia-operator`, breaking the
  ServiceAccount name documented in the cloud setup guides for IRSA and Workload
  Identity
- **CI operator build detection on merge to main** — the `detect-changes` job
  now uses `fetch-depth: 0` so that `dorny/paths-filter` can reliably compare
  against the previous main HEAD on fast-forward merges. With the default
  shallow checkout, operator path changes were not detected and the operator
  build was silently skipped

---

## 0.3.3

**Released:** 2026-02-27

### Added

- **`excessRules` and `uncoveredRules` in ComplianceReport** — the CRD status
  now includes the full rule lists for excess and uncovered permissions, making
  reports self-contained. Previously only counts were reported, requiring manual
  diffs to identify specific unused or ungranted rules
- **"How mTLS Works" section** in the Webhook Setup Guide — clear conceptual
  explanation of the three-step mTLS handshake, moved from the standalone guide
- **"Verify mTLS Is Working" section** in the Webhook Setup Guide — includes
  curl test for unauthorized client rejection

### Changed

- **GCP Pub/Sub v1 → v2** — migrated `cloud.google.com/go/pubsub` to
  `cloud.google.com/go/pubsub/v2`. The v1 library is deprecated and will stop
  receiving patches in mid-2026. `Subscription` renamed to `Subscriber`, import
  path updated; all other APIs unchanged
- **GitHub Actions major upgrades** — `actions/upload-artifact` v6 → v7,
  `actions/download-artifact` v7 → v8 in CI and nightly workflows
- **Go module updates** — Kubernetes client libs `0.35.0` → `0.35.2`, AWS SDK
  `v1.36` → `v1.41`, Google Cloud/gRPC libraries, `golang.org/x/*` packages
- **Site dependency updates** — Deno runtime `2.6.10` → `2.7.1`, KaTeX `0.16.32`
  → `0.16.33`
- **Getting-started guides use values files** — all installation guides now show
  named `values-*.yaml` files (`values-file.yaml`, `values-webhook.yaml`,
  `values-webhook-mtls.yaml`, `values-dual.yaml`) instead of long `--set` chains
- **File-based `kubectl apply`** — quick-start guides use
  `kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml` instead of heredoc (`<<EOF`) patterns
- **Self-contained quick starts** — file and webhook quick-start guides now
  include their own Helm install steps instead of deferring to the installation
  page
- **mTLS documentation consolidated** — `webhook-setup.md` is now the single
  source of truth for all webhook TLS and mTLS configuration; `mtls-setup.md`
  replaced with a redirect page preserving existing bookmarks
- **Cross-references updated** — 7 links across 5 files now point to the correct
  `webhook-setup.md` anchors instead of `mtls-setup.md`
- **Renovate config** — excluded own operator image
  (`felixnotka/audicia-operator`) from digest pinning since the tag is set by CI
  at build time

### Fixed

- SonarQube quality gate failure on `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` — excluded
  generated deepcopy files (`**/zz_generated.*.go`) from duplication analysis

---

## 0.3.2

**Released:** 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- E2E file-mode tests failing after audit log path migration: the kube-apiserver
  creates audit log files with `0600` permissions (owner-only). The E2E helm
  install now sets `runAsUser=0` to match production file-mode requirements,
  where root access is needed to read the audit log
- Deployment template hostPath volume type changed from `File` (requires
  pre-existing file) to unset (no pre-existence check), improving compatibility
  with clusters where the audit log is created by the kube-apiserver at startup

---

## 0.3.1

**Released:** 2026-02-26

### Added

- **`hostNetwork` Helm value** — enables host network namespace for the operator
  pod, bypassing CNI service routing issues on control plane nodes. Required for
  file-mode deployments on Cilium and other kube-proxy-free clusters where pods
  cannot reach the Kubernetes API server ClusterIP (`10.96.0.1:443`). See the
  updated [Kube-Proxy-Free Guide](guides/kube-proxy-free.md)
- **`dnsPolicy` Helm value** — configurable DNS policy; automatically set to
  `ClusterFirstWithHostNet` when `hostNetwork` is enabled
- **Startup retry with exponential backoff** — the operator now retries startup
  up to 5 times (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s, capped at 60s) instead of crashing
  immediately on transient API server connectivity failures. Configurable via
  `STARTUP_MAX_RETRIES` environment variable
- Kube-Proxy-Free Guide updated with a dedicated
  [File Mode section](guides/kube-proxy-free.md#file-mode-hostnetwork) covering
  the `hostNetwork` workaround

### Changed

- **Default audit log path** — standardized to
  `/var/log/kubernetes/audit/audit.log` across Helm defaults, docs, examples,
  and kind configs, matching the CNCF recommended path (previously
  `/var/log/kube-audit.log`)
- **Leader election disabled by default** — single-replica deployments (the
  default) no longer require leader election, removing an unnecessary API
  dependency at startup. Enable it explicitly with
  `operator.leaderElection.enabled=true` when running multiple replicas
- File mode installation examples across all docs now include
  `--set
  hostNetwork=true` for kube-proxy-free clusters

### Fixed

- Operator startup failure on Cilium kube-proxy-free clusters in file mode: pods
  on control plane nodes could not reach the Kubernetes service ClusterIP
  through the CNI datapath, causing `dial tcp 10.96.0.1:443: i/o timeout` during
  RBAC cache informer initialization
- `staticcheck SA1019` — replaced deprecated `result.Requeue` with
  `result.RequeueAfter` in controller reconcile tests

---

## 0.3.0

**Released:** 2026-02-25

### Added

- **SonarQube quality gate enforcement** — PRs that fail the SonarQube quality
  gate can no longer be merged; the `sonarqube-quality-gate-action` step blocks
  the pipeline
- **Nightly CI workflow** — Scheduled build (02:00 UTC daily) runs tests,
  coverage, and SonarQube analysis independently of the main pipeline; also
  supports manual dispatch
- **E2E tests in main pipeline** — End-to-end tests now run as part of the
  standard lint-and-test workflow on every PR, not just nightly
- **Per-cloud-provider Docker images** — CI builds separate images with `azure`,
  `aws`, and `gcp` build tags alongside the default cloud-free image
- **README badges** — Pipeline status, nightly status, and license badges
- **Controller test coverage** — Unit tests for `flushCloudCheckpoint`,
  `eventLoop`, and additional uncovered controller paths
- **EKS and GKE documentation** — Quick start guides, setup guides, and example
  manifests for AWS CloudWatch Logs and GCP Pub/Sub ingestion

### Fixed

- 19 SonarQube code issues across operator and site: reduced cognitive
  complexity in GCP parser and docs search index builder, replaced deprecated
  patterns (`.match()` → `RegExp.exec()`, `.replace()` → `.replaceAll()`), added
  `Readonly` props, switched to `TypeError`, used `String.raw` template tags,
  stable React keys, and PascalCase component naming
- 3 additional SonarQube issues from post-scan feedback: removed unnecessary
  non-null assertions, fixed interactive role on non-interactive element
- Controller `staticcheck QF1008` — removed redundant embedded field selector
- E2E race condition and lint errors in controller tests
- Duplicate `.footer` CSS selector merged into one block

### Changed

- SonarQube coverage and duplication exclusions tuned to reduce false positives
  on test files, site code, and cloud provider adapters
- Docs navigation updated with EKS/GKE cloud examples

---

  Cloud Logging LogEntry parsing and raw K8s event auto-detection
- **SEO foundation** — Meta tags, sitemap, RSS feed, 404 page, and internal link
  structure for the documentation site
- **Blog content** — 20 SEO blog posts covering Kubernetes RBAC, audit logging,
  and security automation topics

### Fixed

- GCP parse lint error — removed always-nil error return
- GCP parse type error and missing cloud adapter dependencies

---

- **[RBAC Policy Generation](concepts/rbac-generation.md) concept page** —
  explains what gets generated, the observation-to-RBAC pipeline, safety
  guardrails, and how to use the output

### Changed

- **Consolidated kube-proxy-free content** into a single dedicated
  [Kube-Proxy-Free Guide](guides/kube-proxy-free.md) instead of duplicating
  across 7 files
- Main webhook docs (setup, quick start, mTLS, installation, helm values) now
  focus on the standard ClusterIP path with callout links to the kube-proxy-free

- Removed unrelated Istio IP preservation section from kube-proxy-free guide

---
